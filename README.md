# World Weather Analysis with Python APIs
### An analysis of worldwide weather data to determine ideal travel plans based on preferred temperature

## Overview
#### This analysis utilizes Python APIs from OpenWeatherMap and Google Places to build a hypothetical application for PLANMYTRIP, a top travel technology company in the hotel and lodging industry. The application will suggest ideal vacation spots for each customer by allowing the client to specify their preferred temperature ranges. Not only will it return the ideal cities, but the application is able to map the hotels near these destinations as well.
